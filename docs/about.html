                            Peter was born 22 years ago in a small town called ZhongShan in China. He spent most of his
                            years growing up
                            in ZhongShan. At an early age, he already knew he wanted to explore the world and live a
                            curious life.
                            Throughout the years he developed skills that would help him through life, such as being
                            open-minded,
                            obtaining a positive attitude, and always learning.


                            During high school, he wanted to start a career in business; thus he had an emphasis on
                            learning economics and math.
                            Little did he know, he changed his passion very fast. Peter did not enter college pursuing a
                            business degree.
                            He wanted to learn something different, and he chose <strong>Physics</strong>. The reason
                            was purely because of the movie <em>Interstellar</em>.
                            The mathematical logic and romance of the universe was what attracted Peter into fancying
                            this particular topic.
