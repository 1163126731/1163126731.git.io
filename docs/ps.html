                        Peter gained his optoelectronic skills in Dr. Rogachev's laboratory, focusing on spectrum analysis of commercial OLEDs. 
                        The project involved discovering a modeling method for OLEDs through admittance spectroscopy.

                        The role required maintenance of structured LabView code, Python simulation, and LTspice for operational amplifier designs. 
                        He designed a two-stage amplifying process using AD8065 high-speed amplifiers to reach higher spectrums for data analysis.

                        Peter built practice code executing Gaussian fits on random data using Maximum Likelihood and neural networks. 
                        He is currently studying "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop.
                        The implementation of machine learning comes handy when Peter searches knwoledge in that of quantative financing.
                        <a href="../Notes/Introduction to PRML.html" >Notes</a> were made in <strong>Latex</strong> language when he types and refreshes his mind in his favorite note keepe -Jupyter notbooke.

                    <h2>Website Designing</h2>
                    <p class="par">
                        Peter helped design and maintain the website for his father, Luke Chan. 
                        He continues to refine his skills in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> to build professional portfolios.
                        He realizes his flaws in terms of professional coding skills, thus he starts adopting Google's AI at the start of 2026.
                        The code is much cleaner and saves precious time. Peter strongly believes that the AI is better at coding then he is, but understanding the 
                        code requires time and experience. This is the true strength of coders in this modern era.
