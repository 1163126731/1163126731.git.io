                    Peter gained his optoelectronic skills while participating in Dr.Rogachev's laboratory.
                    He was in charge of a on going project, which consists of spectrum analysis of a commercial OLED. 
                    The project, in short, is where we try to discover a modeling method for OLEDs through it's light spectrum. The desired modeling  is 
                    completed through admittance spectroscopy.

                    The definiton of admittance spectroscopy is the inspeciton on the current response of a device to small AC bias voltage modulation and its dependence on frequency.
                    If we picture the OLED as a circuit that consists of series of capacitance(Energy stored) and resistors (Emitting layer), the conductance and susceptance of the circuit
                    can successfully depecit the electrical chracteristics of our OLED. This brings further understanding on the OLED that one might not know of, the specturm analysis alone 
                    gives one the ability to harness the chractreistics of one's need.

                    The position requires 
                    extensive maitainence of structured Lab view code,python simulation, and LTspice for typical operational amplifer designs. 
                    The design that Peter was in charge of was a two stage amplifing process which consists of two AD8065 high speed amplifers,
                    with a stable feed back network and high cut off frequency, allowing our project to reach higher spectrum for better data analysis on 
                    our program.
